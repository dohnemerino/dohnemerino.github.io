        <q>Who are we? Where are we going in life? What is the meaning of all of this? These are questions Li'l Sebastian never had to answer, because he was a horse.</q>

        <p>Lil sebastian was the best mini horse that ever walked this great planet. When something is so terrible that it makes a Swanson cry, we know the loss of our great furry friend is beyond unbearable for us mere mortals. We miss you everyday buddy, and hope you are enjoying your wings up in horsy heaven.</p>

            <p>Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing<br>
            You trade your legs for angels wings<br>
            And once we’ve all said good-bye<br>
            You take a running leap and you learn to fly</p>

            <p>Bye bye Li'l Sebastian<br>
            Miss you in the saddest fashion<br>
            Bye bye Li'l Sebastian<br>
            You’re 5000 candles in the wind</p>

            <p>And though we all miss you everyday<br>
            We know you're up there eating heaven's hay<br>
            And here's the part that hurts the most<br>
            Humans cannot ride a ghost</p>

            <p>Bye bye Li'l Sebastian<br>
            Miss you in the saddest fashion<br>
            Bye bye Li'l Sebastian<br>
            You’re 5000 candles in the wind</p>

            <p>Maybe someday we'll saddle up again<br>
            And I know I'll always miss my horsiest friend<br>
            Spread your wings and fly<br>
            Spread your wings and fly</p>
